\usage{
outlierprocess(
  processedBetas = NULL,
  quantilemethod = NULL,
  trimming = FALSE,
  pct = 0.005,
  cohort = NULL,
  analysisdate = NULL,
  destinationfolder = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{processedBetas}{The preprocessed beta-value matrix}

\item{quantilemethod}{A character string indicating the approach to estimate
quantiles. Two options: 'EmpiricalBeta' or 'Quantile'. To estimate the
quantiles based on the empirical beta distribution, specify 'EmpiricalBeta'.
To estimate the quantiles using the quantiles function (type7), specify
'Quantile'.}

\item{trimming}{Logic statement (TRUE/FALSE; default is FALSE). If FALSE,
winsorize the outliers based on the specified percentile. If TRUE, trims the
outliers based on gaps larger than 3*IQR; the cutoff for the number of
outliers in a group is either a maximum of 5 or 0.0025 of the total number
of samples (whichever is larger). Detected outliers are recoded as NA.}

\item{pct}{Numeric value indicating the percentile winsorized on each side of
the distribution; default is 0.005, indicating winsorizing 1 percent.}

\item{cohort}{A character string for the cohort's acronym (e.g. "HEBC")}

\item{analysisdate}{A character string indicating the date the analysis was
run. Please specify in the form: YEARMONTHDAY, e.g. "20200205" for February
5th 2020}

\item{destinationfolder}{A character string indicating the location where
files should be saved, e.g. "C:\\Home\\PACE\\BirthSize"}
}
\value{
Returns and saves an RData file of the preprocessed beta-value matrix
 with the outliers removed or corrected. Also saves a csv of the CpG
 distributions after removing or correcting the outliers, a csv of the number
 of outliers per CpG locus, and a csv of the proportion of outliers per
 sample.

\description{
Correcting outliers from the beta-value matrix based on specified
 approach
}
\details{
If estimating the quantiles based on the empirical beta
 distribution, the shape parameters are estimated using the method of moments
 approach. If trimming is TRUE, remove extreme outliers based on gaps that
 must be at least 3*IQR; the cutoff for the number of outliers in a group is
 either a maximum of 5 or 0.0025 of the total number of samples (whichever is
 larger). Detected outliers are recoded as NA.
